## Problem Definition

Week 1 Project:

Question: Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that.

So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? Like, what steps would you take to create a machine learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?

### Proposed Solution

**Understanding the problem statement**

Customer churning is the action of when a customer chooses to abandon their service provider. Firms such as Sprint recognize customer churning as a great loss since they have already invested in attracting these customers. This is one of the major reasons that customer retention is beneficial for a firm. Customers can churn for many reasons and it is hard to pinpoint a general reason for churning. The availability of information has given consumers a bargaining power, and nowadays customers can easily find the service provider, which provides the same product with a more satisfying deal.
To manage this, companies invest in churn prediction methods by trying to predict which of their customers
will churn, so that they can apply preventative measures. Analyzing customer behavior serves as the basis for predicting customers who might churn.

I propose using a machine learning model to predict which customers are most likely to leave in the upcoming months. We need to understand the meaning of customer churning in Sprint company context. For the purpose of these project, I will assume that customer churning means that the customer switches to the competitor, so they no longer use services provided by Sprint. I will assume we are predicting customer churn for the next 6 months. Additionally, we will need to understand what kind of data is available and how much historical data Sprint company has because the predictive model will use the trends from historical data to ake predictions using the current data.

The following steps have been used to provide a solution to the problem of customer churn in order for the firm to take preventative actions in advance.
